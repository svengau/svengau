## My typical work day

In the morning, a good cup of coffe, checking new messages on emails / slack, fixing urgent bugs if any, reviewing PRs to help my teammates. And daily standup of course.
In the afternoon, working on new features.
From time to time, viewing a tech presentation from one of my teammates, and socializing with them on Zoom :)

A few companies that I like

- [Buffer](https://buffer.com) for their full transparency,
- [unstoppabledomains](https://unstoppabledomains.com) for trying to define a decentralized Web Identity,
- [beta.gouv](https://beta.gouv.fr) for all their public interest projects,
